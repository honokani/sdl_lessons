# solving SDL2 lessons  
   Problems in [here](http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/).  
   With great help by [this repository](https://github.com/palf/haskell-sdl2-examples).  

# policy  
   I solve lessons with haskell.  
   Maybe.  

# memo  
   *  lesson01  
      +  I implemented it very simplely.  
   *  lesson02  
      +  I split some modules into function.  
   *  lesson03  
      +  I separate some modules as SDL2Utils.
